    "\n",
    "H1 is a dataset that was collected for open loop calibration of a BCI for robot arm control. The dataset contains neural activity of a human participant as they attempted to reach and grasp their right hand according to visually cued motion for 7 degrees of freedom (DoF). The visual cue was a screen illustrating the desired motion on a virtual arm, and the participant has had practice following these cues to calibrate similar decoders before this dataset was collected.\n",
